### Hi there 👋 I'm devxan 
But you can me Xan. 
- 👍 You should check out my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/devxan).
- 🔭 I work on animations on [Scratch](https://Scrach.mit.edu/users/-Xanimation-/)!
- 🌱 I use the prototyping tool [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) as my graphic design platform, even though it's for prototyping. 
- 🤔 I don't know a lot about coding in general, but I use the block code language [Scratch](https://Scrach.mit.edu/), which is based off of google's "[Blocky](https://developers.google.com/blockly)"
- 📫 How to reach me: (via Scratch) [Ani-Xan](https://Scrach.mit.edu/users/-Xanimation-/)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I almost died when I was born. (Fun, right? LOL, not really.)
- 🎮 I play Minecraft Java Edition as "Xanilan". I usually play on [InvadedLands](http://invadedlands.net/) Survival, but you can sometimes find me on [Skyblock Network](https://www.skyblocknetwork.com/) or [Hypixel](https://hypixel.net/).
