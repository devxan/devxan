# Hi, <a href="https://xan.lol" target="_blank">I'm Xan Surnamehere</a>

[My website](https://xan.lol)'s code is currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/devxan/site), but that might change as I put more stuff on a forgejo instance.

I have a grand plan of making a new version of my site using a jamstack builder and a ton of css & content.

I'm super good at editing README files (never got around to coding...)! I am the master README editor.

High interest in indie web ([mm](https://github.com/fazlabz-dev/openlink)) (free [stuff](https://github.com/wdhdev/free-for-life))  :trollface: (also why does that exist here)
